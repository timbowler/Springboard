**Santander Product Recommendation**

To support needs for a range of financial decisions, Santander Bank offers a lending hand to their customers through personalized product recommendations.

Under their current system, a small number of Santander’s customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any resulting in an uneven customer experience. In their second competition, Santander is challenging Kagglers to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

With a more effective recommendation system in place, Santander can better meet the individual needs of all customers and ensure their satisfaction no matter where they are in life.


**Instacart Market Basket Analysis**

Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to make it easy to fill your refrigerator and pantry with your personal favorites and staples when you need them. After selecting products through the Instacart app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.

Instacart’s data science team plays a big part in providing this delightful shopping experience. Currently they use transactional data to develop models that predict which products a user will buy again, try for the first time, or add to their cart next during a session. Recently, Instacart open sourced this data - see their blog post on 3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced.

In this competition, Instacart is challenging the Kaggle community to use this anonymized data on customer orders over time to predict which previously purchased products will be in a user’s next order. They’re not only looking for the best model, Instacart’s also looking for machine learning engineers to grow their team.
